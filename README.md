# COVID-19-Sign-Symptom
List of COVID-19 signs and symptoms

Leveraging the community efforts, COVID-19 signs and symptoms were collected from five sources: 

(1) WHO case record form: the SIGNs AND SYMPTOMS ON ADMISSION section of the case record form.[1] 

(2) National COVID Cohort Collaborative: the diagnosis table shared by the national COVID cohort collaborative as phenotyping information.[2] 

(3) MedTagger Lexicon: signs and symptoms together with their synonyms were collected from the lexicon in MedTagger.[3] 

(4) Lexicon from Johns Hopkins: signs and symptoms, and synonyms were collected from an in-house lexicon of Johns Hopkins. 

(5) UMLS CUIs of these signs and symptoms were also assigned manually, with their UMLS synonyms collected. 

After removing redundancy,  55 signs and symptoms (with 153 different CUIs in total) and 3, 213 synonyms were collected from these sources. A comprehensive list of COVID-19 signs, symptoms, their corresponding UMLS CUIs and synonyms can be accessed through GitHub.[4]
